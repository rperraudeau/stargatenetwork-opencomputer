    Add cancel button on adress input interface - when miss clicked on "Add address" E.g.
    Add a Quit button
    Edit existing Addresses
    Reorder existing Addresses
    Draw actual chevron status sign on the right of the Main screen
    Look at StargateNetwork API to check if it is possible to differentiate chevron engaged/locked - or do it manually if possible
    Configuration Interface
      Keep Full History / Keep only 15 last History Entries only
    Credits Interface with links
    Standalone Program for iris control (like a fingerprint scanner)

      Add SGC Logo - if I can find an open-source one
      Add Chevrons Logo
      Add Better Gate interface
    Add language files - very low priority-

  CHECK
