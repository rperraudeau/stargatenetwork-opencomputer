TODO
  FEATURES PLANNED
    Add more pages for addresses
    Add better checking for inputs (forbidden chars E.g.) + Error messages when unvalid
    Add cancel button on adress input interface - when miss clicked on "Add address" E.g.
    Add filter on string to auto-remove Hyphons when necessary
    Add a Quit button
    Edit existing Addresses
    Reorder existing Addresses
    Visual Iris on Main interface
    Draw actual chevron status sign on the right of the Main screen
    Look at StargateNetwork API to check if it is possible to differentiate chevron engaged/locked - or do it manually if possible
    Configration Interface
      Keep Full Hystory / Keep only 15 last History Entires only
    Credits Interface with links
    Standalone Program for iris control (like a fingerprint scanner)
    Check if pictures can be added in OC for a better design - low priority-, if so:
      Add SGC Logo - if I can find an open-source one
      Add Chevrons Logo
      Add Better Gate interface
    Add language files - very low priority-

  KNOWN ISSUES
    Trouble with Hystory interface when too big

  CHECK
    Allow/Ban buttons
    Defence Interface
    Interface optimisation (Dial interface is quite long to be displayed E.g.)
    Tier components requirements (screen/cpu/gpu/memory ...)
